**Simple Linear Regression: Predicting Height from Weight**

This project demonstrates how to build a simple linear regression model using weight and height data. The model is trained to predict height based on weight using basic machine learning techniques.

üìÇ **Project Overview**
- **Objective**: To predict a person's height given their weight using a simple linear regression model.
- **Algorithm**: Simple Linear Regression
- **Dataset**: The dataset contains paired weight and height data.

üìò **Features of the Notebook**
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Insights into the weight and height dataset.
   - Data visualization to understand the linear relationship.
   
2. **Model Building**:
   - Implementation of simple linear regression.
   - Training the model to learn the relationship between weight (input) and height (output).
   
3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).
   - Visualizing the regression line over data points.
   
4. **Prediction**:
   - Use the trained model to predict height based on new weight inputs.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools and Libraries**
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and visualizations.
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for building and evaluating the regression model.
